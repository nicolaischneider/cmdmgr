# UNINSTALL FUNCTION EXPLANATION:
# ===============================
# This script handles the removal of cmdmgr installation in a safe, user-friendly way:
#
# WHAT IT REMOVES:
# - Global cmdmgr binary from /usr/local/bin/cmdmgr (production mode only)
# - Requires manual removal of sourcing lines from .zshrc (shows exact lines to delete)
#
# WHAT IT PRESERVES:
# - All user command files (~/.shell-commands/global/global-commands.sh)
# - All user command files (~/.shell-commands/local-commands.sh)
# - Shows exact file paths and command counts so users can manually import back to .zshrc
# - Does NOT delete any user-created commands or directories
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
# - Requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding
# - Offers to open .zshrc file for manual editing
# - Provides clear instructions for cleanup steps
# - Shows preserved command files with their locations and command counts

# INSTALL FUNCTION EXPLANATION:
# =============================
# This script handles the installation of cmdmgr in two phases:
#
# PHASE 1: Shell Integration Setup
# - Creates ~/.shell-commands/ directory structure for storing user commands
# - Adds sourcing lines to .zshrc so commands are available in new shell sessions
# - Creates empty global-commands.sh and local-commands.sh files if they don't exist
#
# PHASE 2: Global Binary Installation (Production Mode Only)
# - Creates a wrapper script at /usr/local/bin/cmdmgr that calls the main cmdmgr.sh
# - This allows users to type 'cmdmgr' from anywhere in the terminal
# - Requires sudo permissions to write to /usr/local/bin/
# - Shows tutorial with available commands and import suggestion
#
# Test mode only does Phase 1 with test files in the project directory

# Source configuration
